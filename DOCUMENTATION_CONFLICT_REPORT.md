# EXECUTION HALTED: DOCUMENTATION PATH CONFLICT

## 1. Conflict Identification
Execution of the **Kernel Boundary Classification** task has been **HALTED** due to a conflict between the requested mandatory pre-read documents and the actual repository state.

## 2. Evidence of Missing Documents

The following documents listed in the **MANDATORY PRE-READ** section do not exist at the specified paths:

| Requested Path | Status | Actual Found Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/architecture/authentication-architecture.md` | ❌ **MISSING** | `docs/security/authentication-architecture.md` |
| `docs/architecture/failure-semantics.md` | ❌ **MISSING** | `docs/auth/failure-semantics.md` |

## 3. Strict Compliance Determination
The task instructions explicitly state:

> *If any required document is missing or contradictory: → STOP and report the conflict explicitly.*

In strict adherence to this directive, no further analysis or classification has been performed. Please align the task instructions with the current repository structure and resubmit.
