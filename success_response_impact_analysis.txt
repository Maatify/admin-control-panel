SUCCESS RESPONSE IMPACT ANALYSIS REPORT

1. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
   - Frontend Dependency: NO (Code uses HTTP Status Codes 200/204).
     - Note: `data.status` in `admin_emails.js` refers to entity status, not API success flag.
   - Internal Backend Dependency: NO (Code uses standard return types).
   - Test Dependency: NO (No tests asserting `status: ok`).
   - Documentation Dependency: YES (Multiple API contracts strictly define `status: "ok"`).

2. RISK CLASSIFICATION
   - Risk Level: LOW RISK (Runtime) / HIGH RISK (Contract)
   - Reasoning:
     - Runtime change is likely safe as frontend JS relies on HTTP status codes.
     - Contract change is HIGH RISK because documentation strictly defines `status: "ok"`. Any external consumers (if they exist) would break.
     - Replacing `status: "ok"` with `success: true` creates a Documentation/Code mismatch unless docs are updated simultaneously.

3. RECOMMENDATION
   - If normalization to `success: true` is desired:
     - 1. Update all 16 Controller/Route files.
     - 2. Update all 17 Documentation examples.
     - 3. Verify `admin_emails.js` manually to ensure no hidden dependency.
   - If strict adherence to current contract is desired:
     - Keep `status: "ok"`.
